# Book Buddy

Book Buddy is an application that helps you organize, track, and enhance your reading experience. With Book Buddy, you can search for books, add them to your personal library, and categorize them based on your reading progress. Additionally, the app features a unique "Time Swap" functionality, allowing you to balance your screen time with reading time, promoting a healthier digital lifestyle.

## Features

### 1. Search and Add Books

Easily search for books using the app's integrated book search feature. You can add your favorite books to your personal library for future reference.

### 2. Track Reading Progress

Categorize the books in your library into three main shelves:

- **Read:** Mark the books you have completed reading.
- **Currently Reading:** Keep track of books you are currently reading.
- **Want to Read:** Create a wishlist of books you plan to read in the future.

### 3. Time Swap Functionality

The Time Swap feature encourages you to replace some of your screen time with reading time. Here's how it works:

- **Step 1:** Add Screen Time: At the beginning of each week, log the total hours spent on screens during the previous week.

- **Step 2:** Set Daily Reading Goal: Define a daily reading goal, which should be equivalent to the total screen time logged for the specific day of the previous week.

- **Step 3:** Start the Timer: Activate the timer for the daily reading goal. You need to spend the same amount of time reading that day to complete the Time Swap.

- **Step 4:** Track Progress: Throughout the week, the app will help you keep track of your daily reading progress and display your Time Swap achievements.
