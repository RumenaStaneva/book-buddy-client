## Deployment

Book Buddy is deployed and accessible at [book-buddy.tech](https://book-buddy.tech).

## Features

### 1. Search and Add Books

Easily search for books using the app's integrated book search feature. You can add your favorite books to your personal library for future reference.

### 2. Track Reading Progress

Categorize the books in your library into three main shelves:

- **Read:** Mark the books you have completed reading.
- **Currently Reading:** Keep track of books you are currently reading.
- **Want to Read:** Create a wishlist of books you plan to read in the future.

### 3. Time Swap Functionality

The Time Swap feature encourages you to replace some of your screen time with reading time. Here's how it works:

- **Step 1:** Add Screen Time: At the beginning of each week, log the total hours spent on screens during the previous week.

- **Step 2:** Set Daily Reading Goal: Define a daily reading goal, which should be equivalent to the total screen time logged for the specific day of the previous week.

- **Step 3:** Start the Timer: Activate the timer for the daily reading goal. You need to spend the same amount of time reading that day to complete the Time Swap.

- **Step 4:** Track Progress: Throughout the week, the app will help you keep track of your daily reading progress and display your Time Swap achievements.
