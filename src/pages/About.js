                    <p className="paragraph">Like many others, I too fell into the trap of excessive screen time as technology became an integral part of our lives. As a child, I was an avid reader, devouring two books a day at the young age of eight. Books were my magical escape, and each page turned opened doors to new adventures and knowledge.
                        However, as the allure of smartphones and digital gadgets grew, my reading habit gradually faded into the background. The countless hours I once spent immersed in books were now spent scrolling through social media feeds, binge-watching shows, and constantly seeking digital stimulation. Before I knew it, my treasured books started gathering dust, and the joy of reading seemed like a distant memory.
                        Rediscovering the Love for Reading: Introducing Time Swap
                        Time Swap was born out of the realization that I, like many others, needed to rekindle my love for reading and reclaim the balance between screen time and quality reading moments. It's a heartfelt mission to help you break free from the endless digital loop and embrace the magic of books once again.</p>
